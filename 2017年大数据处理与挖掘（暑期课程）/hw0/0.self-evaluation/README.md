Assignment 0. Self Evaluation
=============================

Time being limited and contents intensive, the course is somewhat demanding, especially in your familarity with Python and your programming skills.

In light of this, we created this notebook to help you do self-evaluation.
Please download the notebook and try to finish the challenges in it.

If you can finish the challenges without too much efforts, you are good to go.
If you can't, however, you should reconsider whether you should enroll in this course then.
We won't insist you quit in such cases, but... Well, you have been warned :smile:

To start, first click on [this](L0.python3-and-jupyter.ipynb) to preview the notebook on Github and follow the instructions to set up your environment.
After that, download the notebook to your local machine and try to work on it.

If you have any questions, please consult the TAs.
