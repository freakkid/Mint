* Maze: 
    
    + The game is on when player hovers the **S** block by mouse.
    
    + The game is over if player hovers the **E** block or he hovers the **walls** carelessly. When the game is over, the result of game will be displayed.

    + For I set a **cheat valid** block on the left of the **start** block, all of the cheating will be detected.

* Mole: 

    + Two ways to make game over: one is waiting for 30s, other is clicking the **Start Game | Stop Game** button. So the score of player can be negative.
    
    + After that, if player click the **Start Game | Stop Game** button again, the game will restart with _0 score and 30 seconds_.

* At last, very thanks for reviewing my code! The homework is so fun that I enjoy it.
